Theme 2: Towards a highly connected Port+ Ecosystem

Demand-supply management in the container logistics ecosystem is a critical aspect of ensuring efficient operations. Firstly, it involves forecasting demand for container shipments, taking into account various factors such as seasonal fluctuations and market trends. Secondly, supply management entails optimizing the availability of containers, ensuring that there are enough containers to meet the demand at key locations and times. Thirdly, it involves capacity management for container ships and terminals, making sure that the infrastructure can handle the expected volume of shipments. Effective demand-supply management helps prevent congestion at ports, reduces shipping delays, and lowers operational costs. This balance between supply and demand is essential for maintaining the fluidity and reliability of container logistics.
